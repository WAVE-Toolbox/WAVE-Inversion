#
# interface: y coordinate (in gridpoints of a underlying regular grid with NY gridpoints). Must increase with layer.
# dhFactor: grid stretch factor. Only changes of factor 3 are alowed eg 1<->3 or 9<->3. dhFactor=1 is the spacing of the underlying regular grid.
# FDOrder: Can be set between 2-12 per layer of the discontinous grid or a regular grid (dhFactor=1 for all layers)
